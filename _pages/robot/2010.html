    <p>The robot had to kick soccer balls into one of the two goals which were placed at each corner of the field. The playing area was divided into three parts by a bar that robots could either pass below (in 3 holes designed for this purpose) or beyond the bars itself. The robots had to launch balls and were not allowed to move with the balls. They also had to protect their goals the other team, who were each composed of three robots. If, crossing the hump, a robot is reversed, another robot of the team could go back. At the end of the match, the robots could go hang on structures located in the media moguls. Points were given as follows: 1 point when a ball entered the goal, 2 points when the robot managed to hang on the structure, and 3 points when a robot on robot already hung suspended.
