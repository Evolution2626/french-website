    <p>The challenge of this year is to make passes between the robots of our alliance with an exercise ball. The more passes (assits) we make, the more points we have. On each extremity, we have a goal, some give 10 points and some give 1 points (in the lower corners). The first assist does not give points but the second and the third give 10 and 30 points. In the center of the area there is  a beam about 6 feet off the ground. If an assit passes over it, 10 points are given to our aliance and if a robot catches the ball, we have an other 10 points. All these points are attributed only if we score a goal with the ball. For a more detailed description, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxp4dkMQ1Vo">the official video reveal</a>.</p>
