    <h5>Summer Camps</h5>
    <p>Since summer 2011, the team 2626 has decided to make a robotics camp at the SÃ©minaire de Sherbrooke. This camp gives the opportunity to young students aged from 10 to 14 to resolve several challenges with the NXT Mindstorm Lego sets. Our popular student & alumni-powered summer camp brings the love of STEM and the values of FIRST into the lives of hundreds of eager students. We set them challenges, and they learn G.P. by competing with themselves and others in a respectful, positive manner. They reach new heights through teamwork and collaboration, and rebound from failures to overcome difficulties through Coopertition.</p>
    <p>In Summer 2016, Evolution 2626 offered an 8-week long program. We speak, teach and inspire both French and English!</p>
